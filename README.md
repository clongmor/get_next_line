# get_next_line
Second project in the WeThinkCode_ course first year.
Designing a programme that reads in text from a given file descriptor until it finds a newline character or reaches the end of the input.
It stores the text it reads in, in a provided string variable and can be run in a while loop to effectively read in a whole file with many
newlines, and store/modify it line by line.
